    cy.get('#number2').click();
    cy.get('.display').should('contain', '2')
  })
})

// 1. Do the number buttons update the display of the running total?
// 2. Do the arithmetical operations update the display with the result of the operation?
// 3. Can multiple operations be chained together?
// 4. Is the output as expected for a range of numbers (for example, positive, negative, decimals and very large numbers)?
// 5. What does the code do in exceptional circumstances? Specifically, if you divide by zero, what is the effect? Write a test to describe what youd 
// prefer to happen, and then correct the code to make that test pass (you will need to modify the Calculator model to meet this requirement).
